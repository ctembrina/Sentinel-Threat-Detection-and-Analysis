# Sentinel Threat Detection and Analysis




<h2>Description</h2>
This project demonstrates the deployment of a cloud-based Security Operations Center (SOC) using Microsoft Azure Sentinel (SIEM) to detect and analyze intrusion attempts targeting a Windows Virtual Machine (VM). The architecture showcases how real-time telemetry and security logs are collected, analyzed, and visualized through an integrated cloud security pipeline.


<h2>Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Microsoft Azure Portal – Cloud management and deployment interface</b> 
- <b>Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) – Security Information and Event Management for detection and analysis</b>
- <b>Azure Log Analytics Workspace – Log collection and data correlation</b>
- <b>Azure Virtual Machine (Windows Server) – Host system for attack simulation</b>
- <b>Azure Network Security Group (NSG) – Network access control and traffic filtering</b>
- <b>Azure Virtual Network (VNet) – Network isolation and communication routing</b>
- <b>Azure Resource Group – Resource organization and lifecycle management</b>
- <b>Draw.io (diagrams.net) – Architecture diagram design and visualization</b>




<h2>Architecture Description:</h2>

<p align="left">
The lab environment is built within the Azure Cloud Platform, where a Resource Group hosts a Virtual Machine (VM) connected to a Virtual Network (VNet) and protected by a Network Security Group (NSG). The VM is intentionally exposed to the public internet to simulate real-world attack scenarios from external threat actors. Security and event data generated by the VM is ingested into the Log Analytics Workspace, where it is then forwarded to Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) for advanced analysis and correlation. Sentinel workbooks and dashboards visualize detected activities, such as brute-force attempts, suspicious logins, and geographic attack mapping.

<h2>Key Components:</h2>

- <b>Azure Resource Group – Centralized container for managing cloud assets</b> 
- <b>Virtual Machine (VM) – Simulated endpoint targeted by attackers</b>
- <b>Network Security Group (NSG) – Defines inbound and outbound traffic rules</b>
- <b>Log Analytics Workspace – Collects and normalizes security logs</b>
- <b>Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) – Performs detection, analysis, and visualization of attack data</b>
- <b>Attack Map Dashboard – Displays live intrusion attempts based on geolocation data</b>

<h2>Outcomes:</h2>

- <b>Successfully detected and visualized external brute-force and network intrusion attempts</b> 
- <b>Gained hands-on experience configuring Azure Sentinel, Log Analytics, and NSG rules</b>
- <b>Demonstrated understanding of SIEM operations, cloud security architecture, and incident analysis</b>

<h2>Summary</h2>

Created an Azure Free Trial subscription through the Azure Portal, verified identity, and activated default directory services. Configured cost management and billing settings to monitor usage, ensuring no paid resources were deployed during initial setup. Prepared environment for future SOC lab resource creation.
